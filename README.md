# Hillside

An animated logo using GSAP and SVG. The camera pulls back from a window to reveal an apartment building as night falls. The window's curtains pull back to reveal a computer monitor, which turns on. Text slides down into the scene, stars appear in the sky, and twinkle in an infinite repeat.
